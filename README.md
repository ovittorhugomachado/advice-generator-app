# Project Description

This repository contains an advice generator page. The page was created with JavaScript and the use of the **Advice API** (https://api.adviceslip.com/#endpoint-random). Whenever the given button is clicked, the API sends a new piece of advice.

The techniques used in this project are those taught in the advanced Javascript module of the **Dev em Dobro** course. The project also uses **HTML** and **CSS** technologies, used to make the application responsive and with the design proposed by the Frontend Mentor challenge.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the content and elements of the page.
- **CSS**: Visual styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Manipulating elements through the DOM, thus being able to generate new advice whenever the button is clicked.
- **API**: Integration with a system that sends advice. (this API caches the advice for two seconds, so if it is reloaded within that time, the advice will be the same)

## Objective

This project was developed with the purpose of putting into practice the techniques of the advanced JavaScript module and the techniques of using APIs.
